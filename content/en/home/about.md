**St. Louis Shag** _is an up-tempo partnered swing dance that emerged in St. Louis, Missouri during the mid-1930s._

The primary step is an eight-count basic done side-by-side, which is augmented by rhythmic variations using kicks, stomps, cross-overs, quick steps, and brush-steps. Skilled partners will change positions from side-by-side to open, hand-to-hand, back-to-back, and front-to-back positions, as well as break away from one another. Historically, St. Louis Shag was not a stand-alone dance, but an element of the wider Lindy Hop or jitterbug styles featuring swingouts and acrobatics. As a derivative of 1920s partnered Charleston, Shag draws from African-American dance traditions that became an increasingly key aspect of nightlife in urban areas during the early 1900s. Shag dancers value individual expression and lead and follow teamwork.
